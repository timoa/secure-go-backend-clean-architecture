# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[issue board](https://github.com/timoa/secure-go-backend-clean-architecture/issues)**
with the label **vulnerability**. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity,
but historically within a few days.
